How to setup audio on your own PI system:
Their are so many descriptions on how to do this so i dont want
to write the next one. Get ur audio working using for 
example: https://raspberry.tips/raspberrypi-tutorials/raspberry-pi-usb-soundkarte-unter-raspbian-einrichten/

If u have a working audio than call

amixer

with an output like this:

Simple mixer control 'Speaker',0
  Capabilities: pvolume pswitch pswitch-joined
  Playback channels: Front Left - Front Right
  Limits: Playback 0 - 37
  Mono:
  Front Left: Playback 16 [43%] [-21.00dB] [on]
  Front Right: Playback 16 [43%] [-21.00dB] [on]
Simple mixer control 'Mic',0
  Capabilities: pvolume pvolume-joined cvolume cvolume-joined pswitch pswitch-joined cswitch cswitch-joined
  Playback channels: Mono
  Capture channels: Mono
  Limits: Playback 0 - 31 Capture 0 - 35
  Mono: Playback 29 [94%] [6.00dB] [off] Capture 32 [91%] [20.00dB] [on]
Simple mixer control 'Auto Gain Control',0
  Capabilities: pswitch pswitch-joined
  Playback channels: Mono
  Mono: Playback [on]

Now u can see the name of ur simple Mixer control in this case its 'Speaker'

Go to the Audio example which fits to ur system and open the Vol.sh file:

#!/bin/bash

  amixer sget Speaker 1>~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-MyRadio/VOL.log

  
replace the name here 'Speaker' with the one from your amixer output.

Now open the node_helper.js file and search for this lines:

	if (notification === "VolumeUp") {

		exec("amixer -q sset Speaker 10%+", null);
	
	}

	if (notification === "VolumeDown") {
		exec("amixer -q sset Speaker 10%-", null);
	
	}

	if (notification === "Mute") {

		exec("amixer -q sset Speaker toggle", null);
	
	}


Now do the same in this 3 lines and replace with your simple control name.
After done than copy the Vol.sh file to the scripts folder and the node_helper.js
to the modules directory.

Hope this was it.
